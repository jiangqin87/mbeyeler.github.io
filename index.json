Retinal prostheses, now implanted in more than 250 patients worldwide, electrically stimulate surviving cells in order to evoke neuronal responses that are interpreted by the brain as visual percepts ('phosphenes'). However, instead of seeing focal spots of light, users of current epiretinal devices perceive highly distorted phosphenes, which vary in shape not just across subjects but also across electrodes, resulting in distorted percepts. We characterized these distortions by asking users of the Argus retinal prosthesis system (Second Sight Medical Products, Inc.) to draw percepts elicited by single-electrode stimulation on a touchscreen. Based on ophthalmic fundus photographs, we then developed a computational model of the topographic organization of optic nerve fiber bundles in each subject's retina, and used this model to successfully simulate predicted patient percepts. Our model shows that activation of passing axon fibers contributes to the rich repertoire of phosphene shapes reported by patients in our psychophysical measurements, successfully replicating visual percepts ranging from 'blobs' to oriented 'streaks' and 'wedges' depending on the retinal location of the stimulating electrode. This model provides a first step towards future devices that incorporate stimulation strategies tailored to each individual patient's retinal neurophysiology.","tags":[],"title":"A model of ganglion axon pathways accounts for percepts elicited by retinal implants","type":"publication"},{"authors":["M Beyeler"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1535785200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1541488092,"objectID":"a878009f99bdd2530cda5279179e0371","permalink":"https://mbeyeler.github.io/publication/biophysical-model-axonal-stimulation/","publishdate":"2018-09-01T00:00:00-07:00","relpermalink":"/publication/biophysical-model-axonal-stimulation/","section":"publication","summary":"Visual prostheses aim to restore vision to people blinded from degenerative photoreceptor diseases by electrically stimulating surviving neurons in the retina. However, a major challenge with epiretinal prostheses is that they may accidentally activate passing axon fibers, causing severe perceptual distortions. To investigate the effect of axonal stimulation on the retinal response, we developed a computational model of a small population of morphologically and biophysically detailed retinal ganglion cells, and simulated their response to epiretinal electrical stimulation. We found that activation thresholds of ganglion cell somas and axons varied systematically with both stimulus pulse duration and electrode-retina distance. These findings have important implications for the improvement of stimulus encoding methods for epiretinal prostheses.","tags":[],"title":"Biophysical model of axonal stimulation in epiretinal visual prostheses","type":"publication"},{"authors":["M Beyeler","A Rokem","GM Boynton","I Fine"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1503385200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1541491998,"objectID":"0e8e14628dc7d72f65b1a80243da7ed9","permalink":"https://mbeyeler.github.io/publication/learning-to-see-again/","publishdate":"2017-08-22T00:00:00-07:00","relpermalink":"/publication/learning-to-see-again/","section":"publication","summary":"The 'bionic eye'—so long a dream of the future—is finally becoming a reality with retinal prostheses available to patients in both the US and Europe. However, clinical experience with these implants has made it apparent that the visual information provided by these devices differs substantially from normal sight. Consequently, the ability of patients to learn to make use of this abnormal retinal input plays a critical role in whether or not some functional vision is successfully regained. The goal of the present review is to summarize the vast basic science literature on developmental and adult cortical plasticity with an emphasis on how this literature might relate to the field of prosthetic vision. We begin with describing the distortion and information loss likely to be experienced by visual prosthesis users. We then define cortical plasticity and perceptual learning, and describe what is known, and what is unknown, about visual plasticity across the hierarchy of brain regions involved in visual processing, and across different stages of life. We close by discussing what is known about brain plasticity in sight restoration patients and discuss biological mechanisms that might eventually be harnessed to improve visual learning in these patients.","tags":[],"title":"Learning to see again: Biological constraints on cortical plasticity and the implications for sight restoration technologies","type":"publication"},{"authors":["M Beyeler","GM Boynton","I Fine","A Rokem"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1498892400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1541491998,"objectID":"b5611c38db37a9e44e577e58b799d70e","permalink":"https://mbeyeler.github.io/publication/pulse2percept/","publishdate":"2017-07-01T00:00:00-07:00","relpermalink":"/publication/pulse2percept/","section":"publication","summary":"By 2020 roughly 20 million people worldwide will suffer from photoreceptor diseases such as retinitis pigmentosa and age-related macular degeneration, and a variety of retinal sight restoration technologies are being developed to target these diseases. One technology, analogous to cochlear implants, uses a grid of electrodes to stimulate remaining retinal cells. Two brands of retinal prostheses are currently approved for implantation in patients with late stage photoreceptor disease. Clinical experience with these implants has made it apparent that the vision restored by these devices differs substantially from normal sight. To better understand the outcomes of this technology, we developed pulse2percept, an open-source Python implementation of a computational model that predicts the perceptual experience of retinal prosthesis patients across a wide range of implant configurations. A modular and extensible user interface exposes the different building blocks of the software, making it easy for users to simulate novel implants, stimuli, and retinal models. We hope that this library will contribute substantially to the field of medicine by providing a tool to accelerate the development of visual prostheses.","tags":[],"title":"pulse2percept: A Python-based simulation framework for bionic vision","type":"publication"}]
